<br>Instructions:<br>
In order to get married you first have to be engaged. To get engaged, simply target your desired partner and type in the command ".engage" without the quotes. For this to work, you both need to be on each other's friends list. To do this, you need to type "/friendinvite PlayerName" without the quotes where PlayerName is the name of your partner.<br><br>
Once engaged, you ask me to get you married. %replace%<br><br>
Once married, you can use the command ".gotolove" without the quotes, to teleport to your partner any time. If you wish to divorce, simply type the command ".divorce" without the quotes.
